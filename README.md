# Etherbet
Etherbet was an online betting site based on the Ethereum Blockchain. 

You find a match that you would like to bet on and place your bet on a winning team (or on a draw). You claim your prize once the match is played and result is known. The prize pool is splitted between the ones that make a bet for the winning result. The contract divides the prize between the winners in proportion to their bets. 

It used to run on onion network.
